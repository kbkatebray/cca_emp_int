abstract: |
  Empathy is a multidimensional construct, which includes cognitive (i.e., understanding another’s emotional state) and affective (i.e., experiencing and reacting to another’s emotional state) components. Studies in adults have demonstrated that both affective and cognitive empathy are related to anxious and depressive symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine these associations in childhood, where there is relatively less research. Participants were 127 9- and 10-year-old children, recruited from the community. Self-report measures of cognitive and affective empathy, and internalizing symptoms were administered, as well as a task-based measure of cognitive empathy. Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that components of affective empathy, specifically affective sharing and empathic distress, were associated with internalizing (particularly social anxiety) symptoms. Although empathy is important for successful social interaction, this study suggests that children who share each other’s emotions strongly are more likely to experience anxiety, particularly of a social nature.
